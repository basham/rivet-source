# Quote
Call prominent attention to a quotation using large text and a citation

## When to use
Use the quote component when you have a quotation that you would like to display prominently in your page. This could include:

- A sentence or short phrase quoted by an important person
- A short testimonial from a user about a specific product

## When to use something else
If the quote is too long to easily read, consider using the HTML `blockquote` element or general paragraph styles instead.
