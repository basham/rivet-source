        # Modal dialog

        A modal dialog is similar to a regular modal except that **it requires the user to interact with it** before continuing any interaction with the main application. The user must select from the available actions in the dialog—they cannot disregard and simply close the window.

        ## Usability notes

        ### When to use

        - Confirmation dialogs used to verify the action a user selected, especially when that action will result in the loss of data. For example, ‘All files in this folder will be deleted. Do you want to continue?’
        - Provide the user with clarifying information before they continue with a task or action. For example, "A 10% fee will be charged to your account. Do you want to continue?"

        ### When to consider something else

        - Do not use to second guess the users’ choice of actions when no destruction or loss of data will occur.
        - When you need to create a focused space for users to complete a small subtask, use a regular modal instead.
