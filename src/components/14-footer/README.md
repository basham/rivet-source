# Footer

The base footer provides consistent branding in a condensed space below all of your application content. It removes the common slogan band, and provides space for localized auxiliary links.

Base footer styling includes height, width, and top border, as well as styling of the left aligned branding requirements, and the optional right aligned auxiliary links.
