# Base header
The base header provides consistent branding in a condensed space. It replaces the common text “Indiana University” with a more useful link to your application’s default view. The base header is the bare minimum version of the header that **must be included in your application**.

## Header extensibility
The base header can be extended to fit the navigation needs of your application by using a handful of smaller sub-components and modifier CSS classes.

- [Identity menu extension](header--id-menu.html)
- [Main navigation extension](./header--main-nav.html)
- [Header with a gray background](./header--gray-background.html)
- [Drawer component](./header--desktop-drawer.html) for additional navigation and tasks
