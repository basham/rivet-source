# Checkbox

Checkboxes allow users to select one or more options from a list of choices.

## When to use

Use checkboxes to allow users to pick zero, one, or many options from a list of values. A checkbox is a good choice when you need to present users a single option that they can turn on or off.

## When to consider something else

When you need to present users with a list of mutually exclusive options and they can select only one option, consider using a list of [radio buttons](#) or a [select input](#).
