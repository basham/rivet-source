# Card
Use the card to visually group related information or represent items in a list.

## Usage
The Card has three variants that affect the way it behaves.

1. The default card
2. The `rvt-card--raised` variant which adds a box shadow, background color, and rounded corner to create a "raised" appearance.
3. The `rvt-card--cover` variant which makes the entire card a clickable link
