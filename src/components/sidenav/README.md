# Sidenav

A sidenav is a vertical display for nested lists of navigation links.

## When to use
- To provide links for navigating sections and pages within another section
- When the order and nesting of the lists match the site structure of pages

## When to consider something else
- When the links do not direct to other pages within the site
- When the nested lists within the navigation exceeds four levels deep
