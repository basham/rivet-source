# Sidenav
A vertical display for nested lists of navigation links

## Description
Use the sidenav component to provide users with the ability to navigate 
nested sections and links relative to where the user is currently at on the 
site.

The sidenav is useful to allow the user to quickly navigate to a page nested
deeply within a section, without having to navigate to each page along the way 
individually.

## When to use
- To provide links for navigating sections and pages within another section
- When the order and nesting of the lists match the site structure of pages

## When to consider something else
- When the links do not direct to other pages within the site
- When the nested lists within the navigation exceeds four levels deep

## Implementation notes
- Avoid nesting site sections deeper than four levels deep
