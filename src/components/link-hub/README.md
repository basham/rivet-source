# Link Hub
Display a group of links with optional descriptions

## Overview
Use the link hub component to display a series of important links on the page. The link hub is a effective way to create in-page navigation that fits into the flow of your content and helps direct users to important related content.

## Examples and variants
- **Default link hub** - Automatically creates columns of links when parent container becomes large enough. _Auto columns_ functionality.
- **`--stacked` variant** - This gives developers the option to opt out of the default auto columns display and instead always display the link hub items in a stacked list. This would allow developers to create their own grid if they need more control over the layout.

## Usage
- Default variant (automatic grid layout)
- Stacked variant 

### Do
- Keep main link text short, no more that 3-4 words if possible
- Keep description text short, not more than one sentence

### Don't
- Use when you have three or less links to display, use a list of cards instead
- Create link hubs with long (four or more words) main link text. Use the description element to add more context instead
