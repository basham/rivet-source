# Select element
The select element creates a dropdown that allows users to choose one item from a list.

## Usability notes

### When to use
Use the select element when you need to present users with a list of mutually exclusive options and they can **only select one option**.

### When to consider something else
When you only need to present a user with three or less options, consider using a group of [radio inputs](radio-inputs.html) instead.

## Microcopy notes
### Select labels
- Write the label as a word or phrase, not as a sentence, and end it with a colon
- Use sentence-style capitalization

### Select options
- Don't make the content of the select list or combo box (or its units label) part of a sentence
- Write each option as a word or phrase, not as a sentence, and use no ending punctuation
- Use parallel phrasing, and try to keep the length about the same for all options
- Sort options in a logical order â€” names in alphabetical order, numbers in numeric order, and dates in chronological order. Lists with 12 or more items should be sorted alphabetically to make items easier to find.
  - **Exception:** One or more common items may be placed at the beginning of an otherwise sorted set of options, such as placing "United States" at the top of a country select. When placing items out of order, always place a non-selectable separator (---) between the unsorted and sorted items.
