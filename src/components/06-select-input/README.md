# Select element
The select element creates a dropdown that allows users to choose one item from a list.

## When to use
Use the select element when you need to present users with a list of mutually exclusive options and they can **only select one option**.

## When to consider something else
When you only need to present a user with three or less options, consider using a group of [radio inputs](radio-inputs.html) instead.
