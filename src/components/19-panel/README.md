# Panel
Use panels to help group content visually, or call attention to parts of your application.

## Default panel
The default panel in Rivet has a light gray background that can be used to help call out content against the default white stage area.

## Light modifier
You can also create a panel with a white background by adding the `rvt-panel--light` modifier. The light panel can be used when your application has a light gray background.
