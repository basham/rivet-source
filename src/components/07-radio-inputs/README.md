# Radio input
Rodio inputs allow users to select a single value out of a set number of choices.

## When to use
Use radio button when you need to present users with a few mutually exclusive choices and they can only select one option.

## When to consider something else
When you have a longer list of mutually exclusive options (for example a list of 50 states), consider using a [select input](select-input.html).
