# Billboard
Used to feature a high-impact image with a text description and optional call to action.

## Do
- Use in full-width contexts such as home pages or section landing pages
- Alternate layout using the `rvt-billboard--reverse` modifier when stacking multiple billboards on top of one another.

## Don't
- Use billboard in narrow contexts on desktop like a [Details template](#) (will need to link to this once it exists) main content column.
