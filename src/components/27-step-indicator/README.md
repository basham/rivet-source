# Step indicator
The step indicator component can be used to help users keep track of their progress in a multi-step interaction.

- Use `aria-hidden` to hide indicators from screen readers if label has the number of step in it.
- Use `aria-current` to indicate the current state
- Keep labels short (1-2 words)
- When using with links as navigation, wrap in a `<nav>` element
