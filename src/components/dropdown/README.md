# Dropdown

Use the dropdown component to create a list of menu options that can be toggled with a button element.

## When to use

Use a dropdown menu when you need to give users a list of actions or links to choose from.

## When to use something else

Although similar to a native HTML <select> element, the dropdown component should not be used as a replacement inside forms. Use the select element instead when you need to give users a list of mutually exclusive choices while filling out a form.
