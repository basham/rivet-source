# Box

The box component can be used to help visually group related content

## Adding the markup

The most basic version of the box component is made up of a `div` with the class `rvt-box`. Visually, it includes a subtle rounded border and a white background. Padding and margins should be applied with [Rivetâ€™s spacing utility classes](#).

```
<div class="rvt-box">
  This is basic box
</div>
```
