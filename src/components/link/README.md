# Link

Inline text links are used to navigate between documents (pages).

## When to use

- Navigating to a new page or view in your application
- Navigating to different web page, e.g. external documentation

## When to consider something else

Use the button component for:
- Opening or closing a modal or dialog
- Triggering a dropdown menu
- Submitting data to the server

## Implementation notes

Your link should always describe where it will take users. Users tend to scan text online, and elements that stand out (like links) grab attention. Clear links can help users navigate more quickly.

For example, instead of:

> [Learn more](#)

Use:

> [Learn how to reset your passphrase](#)
