# Lists

Lists are used to group and organize collections of content.

## Usability notes

- Use unordered lists `<ul>` when your collection has no specific order.
- Use ordered lists `<ol>` when you want to display content in some specific order like ranking, or a series of steps in a process.
- Use definition lists to display groups of terms with descriptions like a glossary or other metadata. 

## Microcopy notes
Follow the [IT Communications Office’s style guide](https://uits.iu.edu/itco/style-basics) here:

- Maintain a parallel structure. If you begin a list item with a verb, all others should begin with a verb too.
- Don’t include punctuation unless a complete sentence follows in the same bullet (like in the sentence above)

## Implementation notes

You can use the helper class `.uitsds-plain-list` or the mixin `@plain-list` to remove list formatting for display purposes.
