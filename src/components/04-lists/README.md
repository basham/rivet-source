# Lists

Lists are used to group and organize collections of content.

## Usability notes

- Use unordered lists `<ul>` when your collection has no specific order.
- Use ordered lists `<ol>` when you want to display content in some specific order like ranking, or a series of steps in a process.

## Implementation notes

You can use the helper class `.uitsds-plain-list` or the mixin `@plain-list` to remove list formatting for display purposes.

## Resources
- [W3C Docs](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H48.html) about all the lists.
