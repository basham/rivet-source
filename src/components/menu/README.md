# Menu

Provide additional navigation outside of the main header

> New in Rivet 1.6.0

> The menu component is new as of 1.6.0. If you need help updating to 1.6.0, see our instructions for updating Rivet.

## When to use

- To allow users to move between pages in a specific subsection of your application
- To provide users with additional navigation beyond that included in the main application header

## When to consider something else

- For top-level navigation, use components like the header and breadcrumb navigation
- For navigation between steps of a process that's been split across multiple pages, use the step indicator
- To allow users to switch between chunks of related content without having to leave the current page, use tabs
