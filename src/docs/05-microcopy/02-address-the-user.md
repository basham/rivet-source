label: "Address the user"

Content on Indiana University sites and apps often makes a direct appeal to students, faculty, or staff to get involved or take action.

Address the user as you whenever possible. For example:

> Our core campuses, our regional campuses, and IU Online offer a learning environment for every kind of student. Wherever you study, you’ll earn an Indiana University degree and find a community where you belong.

If you’re creating content for multiple users—such as students and faculty—address the primary user as you and refer to secondary users by their roles or titles.

You should also be mindful and inclusive of all users. For questions about respectful, conscious, and empowering language, refer to the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/).
