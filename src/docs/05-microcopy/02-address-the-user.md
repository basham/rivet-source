label: "Address the user"

Content on Indiana University sites and apps often makes a direct appeal to students, faculty, or staff to get involved or take action.

Address the user as **you** whenever possible. For example:

> Our core campuses, our regional campuses, and IU Online offer a learning environment for every kind of student. Wherever **you** study, **you’ll** earn an Indiana University degree and find a community where **you** belong.

If you’re creating content for multiple users—such as students and faculty—address the primary user as you and refer to secondary users by their roles or titles.

## Additional resources

It can be difficult to address the user, provide meaningful content, _and_ suggest next steps concisely. We highly recommend reading these two resources for tips on "choosing the right words":
