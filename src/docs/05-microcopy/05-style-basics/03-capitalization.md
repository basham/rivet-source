**Follow a consistent capitalization scheme.**

Creating trustworthy internal and external communications relies, to a large extent, on the content's consistency. Inconsistent spellings and capitalizations undermine your narrative authority. We follow these capitalization guidelines:

* Do capitalize proper nouns, including names of individuals, places, and agencies
* Don't capitalize agile, unless it is the first word of a sentence
* Do capitalize the first word of every bullet

## Accessibility notes
Using ALL CAPS can cause some screen readers to treat the words as acronyms and say the individual letters. Use other methods, like **bold** or *italic* text, to emphasize a point.
