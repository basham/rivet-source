We follow the Chicago Manual of Style here. The IT Communications Office (ITCO) says it best:

<blockquote>Number formatting: Zero through nine, 10 and up.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Date formatting: July 1 (add the year if date is more than one year prior/after)</blockquote>

See <a href="https://uits.iu.edu/itco/style-basics" target="_blank">ITCO's style guide</a> for more information.

## Percentages
Use the percent sign (%) in these circumstances:
* Tables and in technical or scientific writing. For example: 60% of participants reported experiencing negative side effects.
* Headings and subheadings. For example: Candidate Woof takes 7% lead in the election for best dog.
* Interface labels
* Captions and infographics

The percent sign in these cases improves content's scannability. Otherwise, spell out percent in body copy.
