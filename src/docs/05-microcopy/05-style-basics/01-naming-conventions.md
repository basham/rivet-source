When naming a new system, you should consider the following:

* Is it easy to say and spell?
* Does it describe the system or product?
* Will it work as a URL?

You should be able to answer “yes!” to all of the above--which can often be easier said than done. To choose a descriptive and straightforward name, follow the principles below:

* Don’t use CaMeLbAcK spelling
* Don’t combine multiple words to make a new word (e.g., IndiAccessiBook)
* Ask users for feedback before making a decision
