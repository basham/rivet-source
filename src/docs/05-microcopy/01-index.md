title: "What is microcopy?"
---
Microcopy is any text that stands apart from the content at large, including:

* Page titles
* Page headings (headlines)
* Taglines
* Email subject lines
* Summaries, decks
* Hints, tips, explainers
* Buttons
* Loading states/pages
* Error states/pages

## Why is it important?

Microcopy can answer questions that arise at unexpected obstacles. It can also set expectations and guide the user to the content they need. A helpful login error message, for example, identifies the problem and how to fix it.

Clear, concise microcopy can turn a usable app into a user-friendly one.

TESTING! Please ignore. Yep, just testing once again.
