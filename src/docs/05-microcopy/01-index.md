label: "What is microcopy?"
---
Microcopy is any text that stands apart from the content at large, including:

* Page titles
* Page headings (headlines)
* Taglines
* Email subject lines
* Summaries, decks
* Hints, tips, explainers
* Buttons
* Loading states/pages
* Error states/pages

## Why is it important?

Microcopy can answer questions that arise at unexpected obstacles. It can also set expectations and guide the user to the content they need. A helpful login error message, for example, identifies the problem _and_ how to fix it.

Clear, concise microcopy can turn a usable app into a user-friendly one.

## Our approach

### Start with user needs

* Write in a way that suits the situation. Ask yourself: Who is going to read this? What do they need to know? How might they be feeling?
* Help people find the information they need quickly and easily. Guide them through the process.


### Do the hard work to make it simple

* Use plain language and simple sentences.
* Choose clarity over cleverness.
* Be concise.


### Write for everyone

* Respect the complexity of our users’ experiences.
* Be willing to be surprised about who’s reading your work.


### Build trust

* Talk like a person.
* Tell the truth.
* Use positive language and concrete examples.

### Start small and iterate

* Make sure your content works for users. Don’t be afraid to scrap what’s there and start over.
* Write a draft, test it out, gather feedback, and keep refining.
