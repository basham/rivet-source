## Use plain language
One of the best ways to make content clear and usable is to use plain language.  When we use words people understand, our content is more findable, accessible, and inclusive.

To use plain language, you should:

* **Use easy or short words instead of formal or long ones**

    Buy instead of purchase, help instead of assist, about instead of approximately, etc.

* **Avoid using technical jargon**

    Jargon can be vague or unfamiliar and lead to misinformation--which could affect users’ trust.

* **Be open and specific**

    Figurative language (go forward, one-stop shop, drive out, etc.) often doesn’t say what you actually mean. Simply describe what the user should do.

If you’re struggling to use plain language, try writing conversationally. Picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-on-one, with the authority of someone who can actively help.

## Structure your text

Online, users tend to scan text until they find the information they need. Large chunks of text can overwhelm readers, so break up your text.
1. **Use subheads and bullet points**

    They provide clear narrative structure for readers in a hurry.

2. **Don’t be afraid to use bold or italics to grab attention**

    If you want to include an inline tip or highlight a note, words in bold stand out from the rest of the content.

3. **Put information-carrying words at the beginning of the phrase**

    You should also use the [active voice](/docs/microcopy/active-voice).
