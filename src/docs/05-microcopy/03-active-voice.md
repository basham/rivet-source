Our writing should be concise and direct. We prefer the active voice because it supports brevity and makes written content more engaging, too.

**The active voice helps the reader identify the subject of the sentence.** In the following examples, the person who submits the form and saves the case number is essential information. Omitting that leads to a confusing, impersonal, and longer sentence.

* **Passive**: The request form must be submitted to the approving official.
* **Active**: You must submit the request form to the approving official.


* **Passive**: The case number should be saved in your records.
* **Active**: Save the case number in your records.

When in doubt, cut directly to the verb and give the reader clear directions.
