title: Rivet Design System
---
Our goal is to make it easier for teams to design and develop great experiences for users across websites and applications.

This site is a preview of the Rivet source. It's where we develop new features and components and is not always stable. For that reason you should **always** reference the official Rivet documentation site at [rivet.iu.edu](https://rivet.iu.edu/).

## What is this?

What you are looking at is the authoring environment for our design system. This is where we'll be putting our components through their pacesâ€”designing, developing, testing, and eventually distributing them as a package for designers and developers to use in their projects.

We are using [Fractal](http://fractal.build/) to build and document components for Rivet. Fractal is a component library generator written in Node.js.
