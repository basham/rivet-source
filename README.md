## Using Rivet

To use Rivet on your website or web application, follow the instructions on one of the pages listed below:

- [Install with npm](https://rivet.iu.edu/getting-started/npm/)
- [Download CSS and JavaScript](https://rivet.iu.edu/components/#download-rivet)
- [Use hosted CSS and JavaScript](https://rivet.iu.edu/components/#hosted-css-and-javascript)

## Getting started

This section describes how to start working with Rivet.

### Install Node and npm

Before you can start working with Rivet, you'll need to make sure you have Node and npm installed.

To check if you have both installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
node -v && npm -v
```

If both are installed, you should see version numbers for each. If you don't have Node or npm installed, go to the [Node website for installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Working with the components
To get started working locally on your computer first clone or download this repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.iu.edu/UITS/rivet-source.git
cd rivet-source
```

Next you'll need to install it's dependencies via NPM:

```sh
npm install
```

After you've installed the dependencies, run `gulp dev:serve`. Then, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and you should see the Design System Welcome screen.

The default gulp task will watch all component templates (.hbs) and Sass (.scss) files and recompile and update on each change.

Read more about configuring components on the [Fractal webiste](http://fractal.build/guide/components).

### Submitting a Github issue
To help us understand the kind of contribution you want to make we ask that you first submit a Github issue. Here are a few guidelines to follow when creating a new issue:

1. Go to the Rivet repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source/issues).
3. Click the "New Issue" button.
4. Fill out the provided issue template to the best of your ability. If you are submitting a design concept for a new or existing component please attach a screenshot, a link to an Axure mockup, or feel free to link to example HTML/CSS/javaScript (a link to pen on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) would be great!).
5. After you have filled out the issue template click the **Submit new issue** button to create your new issue :tada:.
6. Once the team has had a chance to review the issue they will either mark it as **request**, or ask you for more information before moving on to the next steps.

### Submitting a pull request
1. Fork the main `rivet-source` repository and then clone your fork locally. Follow [these instructions on syncing your local fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#keep-your-fork-synced). Set your new `upstream` remote to point to `https://github.com/indiana-university/rivet-source.git`.
2. Create a new feature branch off of `develop` (the default branch) with the prefix `feature/` e.g. `feature/modal`
3. Commit your changes. Be sure to keep your commits narrow in scope and avoid committing changes not related to your feature.
4. Locally merge any upstream changes into your feature branch: `git pull upstream develop`
5. Push your feature branch to your fork: `git push origin feature/**your feature**`
6. [Open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with a title and clear description of your feature branch against `develop`

### Testing Javascript
We use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to run automated end-to-end tests on Rivet's JavaScript components. To run tests do the following:

1. Start the local development server by typing `npm run start` in your terminal.
2. Once the development server is running, open a new terminal window and type `npm run cypress:test` to run the Cypress tests.
3. Check the output in your terminal to make sure all the tests ran successfully.
